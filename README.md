## Packages

### Generating package

---

To create a new JavaScript library using NX, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your NX workspace.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
npx nx generate @nx/js:library <library-name> --directory=<directory-name> --unitTestRunner=vitest --publishable --importPath=<import-path>
```

Replace <library-name> with the desired name for your library, <directory-name> with the directory where you want the library to be created, and <import-path> with the import path for your library. Here's an explanation of the arguments:

- `@nx/js:library` is the schematic that will be used to generate the library. This is provided by the `@nx/js` package.
- `<library-name>` is the name of your library. This should be in kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens) and should describe the purpose of your library.
- `--directory=\<directory-name>` specifies the directory where your library will be created. This should be in camelCase (lowercase with no spaces, but with the first letter of each word capitalized).
- `--publishable` creates a library that can be published to an external registry (like npm), or in our case Github Packages.
- `--importPath=\<import-path>` is the import path for your library. This should be in the format `@<scope>/<library-name>`, where `<scope>` is your npm scope (if you have one) and `<library-name>` is the name of your library in kebab-case.
- `unitTestRunner=vitest` parameter in the provided NX command allows you to specify the test runner for the generated package. Since we want to use vitest as our main testing tool we will set it to "vitest".

For example, if you want to create a library called `math-helpers` in the `nodejs` directory that can be published to npm with an import path of `@netspective-labs/math-helpers`, you would run the following command:

```bash
npx nx generate @nx/js:library math-helpers --directory=nodejs --publishable --importPath=@netspective-labs/math-helpers
```

This will generate a new library in the nodejs directory of your workspace with the necessary files and configuration to get started building your library.

### Test package options

To ensure that all packages have unit tests, we need to enforce failure when running the test target for packages without any tests. Additionally, we want to implement Code Coverage to track the percentage of code covered by unit tests.

To set this up, you need to add two parameters, namely `passWithNoTests: false` and `coverage: true`, in the `test` target within the project.json file. These settings will help maintain test coverage and identify packages lacking tests during the test execution process.

```json
"options": {
  "passWithNoTests": false,
  "coverage": true,
},
```

### Building package

---

To build the package run:

```bash
npx nx run <project>:build
```

Replace `<project>` with the name of the project you want to build. You can find the project name in the `project.json` file located at the root directory of the package you are trying to build.

### Publishing package

---

In order to publish the package to _Github Packages_ you'll need to change the `package.json` that's located at the root of it.

```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "git+https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/<PACKAGE_NAME>.git",
  "directory": "path/to/your/package"
},
"publishConfig": {
  "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
}
```

- Add the `repository` property with an object with the properties seen above.

  An example of a valid `url` value would be:

```
git+https://github.com/netspective-labs/commons/math-helpers.git
```

- Set the `directory` property to the actual path to the package. A valid path for the `math-helpers` package that we created earlier as an example would be `packages/nodejs/math-helpers`

- Set the `publishConfig` in order to point to the _Github Packages registry_.

_Note: <PACKAGE_NAME> doesn't have to be neccessarily the name in the `project.json`. Here you can name the package as you want._

Then we also need to change a little bit the `project.json` located at the root of the package.

The `publish` target should look like this:

```json
"publish": {
  "executor": "nx:run-commands",
  "options": {
    "command": "node tools/scripts/publish.mjs <PACKAGE_NAME> {args.ver} {args.tag}",
    "args": "--ver='0.0.1' --tag='latest'"
  },
  "dependsOn": ["build"]
},
```

_IMPORTANT: before publishing your package, run the build command for that package (see "Building" section above)._

After these changes were made, we are ready to publish our package. Make sure you've created a _Github repository_ before publishing, if you didn't this won't work.

```bash
npx nx run <PACKAGE_NAME>:publish
```

This will run the command specified in the `publish.options.command`.

Note: if it's not the first time the package is being published, it may need a version bump. To do this change the version in the `package.json` and also in the `ver` args in `publish.options.args` at the `project.json` file. Otherwise if you do not do this the publish command will throw an error arguing that you can't publish a package with a version that already exists.
